# Obby Creator Music Archive Dump

35k+ uploads, donations, and group dump for Obby Creator Music.

The dump draws from three sources:

* The [OCMusic/api-archive](https://github.com/OCMusic/api-archive/) repository, dumped to [`ocmusic-api-dump`](./ocmusic-api-dump)
* A scraper to download all group uploads and metadata, dumped to [`raw/ocmusic-uploads`](./raw/ocmusic-uploads)
* [A script to fetch all group members](./scripts/group-members.ts), dumped to [`raw/ocmusic-group-members`](./raw/ocmusic-group-members)

From there, [another script](./scripts/process.ts) picks what we needed the
most from all three sources to form one source of truth, dumped to
[`v2.json`](./processed/v2.json) for the current Obby Creator Music Audio
Browser and [`v3.json`](./processed/v3.json) for the upcoming Version 3 of the
Obby Creator Music Browser along with Roblaudio.

The processed dump files can then be fetched from games like the Obby Creator
Music browser. A dedicated package is planned.
