# Obby Creator Music Audio Dump

35k+ uploads, donations, and group dump for Obby Creator Music.

The dump draws from three sources:

* The [OCMusic/api-archive](https://github.com/OCMusic/api-archive/) repository, dumped to [`raw/ocmusic-data`](./raw/ocmusic-data)
* A scraper to download all group uploads and metadata, dumped to [`raw/ocmusic-uploads`](./raw/ocmusic-uploads)
* [A script to fetch all group members](./scripts/group-members.ts), dumped to [`raw/ocmusic-group-members`](./raw/ocmusic-group-members)

From there, [another script](./scripts/process-raw.ts) picks what we needed the
most from all three sources to form one source of truth, dumped to
[`dump.json`](./dump.json). This can then be fetched from games like the Obby
Creator Music browser.

> [!WARNING]
> The code is bad. It was written in less than an hour.
